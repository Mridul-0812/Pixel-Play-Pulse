<h1>About the Website</h1>
<p> My website is a collection of fun and interactive mini-games designed to entertain and challenge users of all ages. Each game offers a unique experience, from online soccer to spaceship manoeuvring, all aimed at providing a delightful break from the daily grind.</p>
<p> The inspiration for this project came from my passion for coding and game development. I wanted to create a platform where I could showcase my skills while also bringing joy to others through engaging gameplay. The idea of combining various mini-games into one cohesive website was particularly appealing, as it allows users to explore different types of games in one place.</p>
<p> I hope that visitors to my website find the games enjoyable and stimulating. Whether you're looking to test your online soccer skills, or simply have fun navigating through a space-themed adventure, there's something for everyone. My goal is to create an inclusive and entertaining environment where users can relax, learn, and have fun.</p>
<p> Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you have a fantastic time playing the games!</p>

<h2>About the Creator</h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Avik Gupta, and I am the creator of this mini-game website. I am a passionate coder and game developer with a keen interest in creating interactive experiences that entertain and engage users. My journey into coding began at a young age, and over the years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and game development frameworks.</p>
<p> Surprisingly, I once started making this website as a school passion project! It was a way for me to combine my love for coding with my desire to create something fun and engaging for others. As I worked on the project, I realized how much I enjoyed the process of designing and developing games, and I knew I wanted to continue pursuing this path.</p>
